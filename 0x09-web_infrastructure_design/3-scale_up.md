Scenario: A user wants to access the website www.foobar.com.

User's Computer:

User enters https://www.foobar.com in the browser.
DNS:

Returns the IP of the load balancer cluster.
HAproxy Load Balancer Cluster:

This now consists of two HAproxy servers. If one fails or is undergoing maintenance, the other can continue to route traffic, ensuring high availability.
The incoming HTTPS request is processed by the active HAproxy instance, and then routed to the appropriate server based on the distribution algorithm.
Firewalls:

Continue to protect our infrastructure, with additional adjustments made to accommodate the traffic patterns for the split components.
Web Server (Nginx):

Serves static content and routes dynamic requests. By dedicating a server to this task, we ensure that high traffic doesn't disrupt other processes and can scale this server if necessary.
Application Server:

Processes dynamic requests and interacts with the database server. Isolating it on its own machine means the application processing doesn't compete with other tasks for resources, ensuring faster response times and improved scalability.
Database Server (MySQL):

Handles all data storage and retrieval operations. Running this on its own dedicated hardware ensures database performance isn't hampered by other tasks and can be finely tuned.
Monitoring & Other Infrastructure Components:

As described in previous scenarios.
Specifics:

Additional HAproxy Load Balancer:

Why: Provides redundancy and ensures high availability. In the event one load balancer fails or needs maintenance, the other can seamlessly take over, ensuring no disruption in traffic handling.
Separate Servers for Web Server, Application Server, and Database:

Why: Separation of concerns and optimization.
Each component has different resource needs. For instance, a database might be more I/O intensive, while an application server might be more CPU-bound. By splitting them, we can optimize each server for its task.
It reduces the blast radius. If one component has an issue, it doesn't directly impact the others.
Scalability: As traffic grows, we can scale each component independently. For instance, we could add more application servers if needed without affecting the web or database servers.
