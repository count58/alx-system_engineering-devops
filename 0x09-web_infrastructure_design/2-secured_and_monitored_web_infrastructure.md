User's Computer:

User enters https://www.foobar.com in the browser.
DNS:

Returns the IP of the load balancer (HAproxy).
HAproxy (Load Balancer):

Uses the SSL Certificate to decrypt the incoming HTTPS request.
Forwards the decrypted request to the appropriate server based on the distribution algorithm.
Firewalls:

One in front of the load balancer to filter incoming traffic.
One between the load balancer and the servers to add another layer of security.
One in front of the MySQL database cluster for added protection against malicious threats.
Two Servers:

Both servers now have a Monitoring Client installed, which collects various metrics and sends them to a centralized monitoring system like Sumologic.

Nginx (Web Server): As before, manages incoming HTTP requests.

Application Server: Processes the dynamic request.

Application Files (Codebase): Each server contains a replica of the website code.

MySQL Database:

Primary (Master) Node: The main database where all writes occur. Also has a Monitoring Client.
Replica (Slave) Node: Handles read requests.
Specifics:

Firewalls: Protects the infrastructure from unauthorized access and various malicious activities. It allows legitimate traffic to pass while blocking potentially harmful traffic.

SSL Certificate: Authenticates the website's identity and encrypts the data between the user's browser and the website. Traffic served over HTTPS is secure, protecting the user's data from eavesdropping and tampering.

Monitoring Clients: These are agents that collect metrics from various components (like servers) and send them to a centralized system for analysis and alerting.

Purpose: Monitoring helps in identifying issues proactively, ensuring system health, and analyzing trends or anomalies in performance.
Data Collection: The clients collect metrics like CPU usage, memory consumption, network activity, etc., and forwards this to the centralized monitoring system.
QPS (Queries Per Second) Monitoring: To monitor the web server's QPS, configure the monitoring client to collect metrics from Nginx's access logs or status module, and send this data to the monitoring system.
Issues:

SSL Termination at Load Balancer:

The traffic between the load balancer and servers is unencrypted unless you set up another encryption layer. This can expose sensitive data within the internal network.
It also places a computational load on the load balancer as it has to handle the encryption and decryption of all incoming and outgoing traffic.
One MySQL Server for Writes:

This is a bottleneck. If the primary node fails, there's downtime until a new primary is elected or the original is restored.
All write traffic funnels through this server, potentially leading to performance issues if there's high write demand.
Servers with All Components:

Security Risks: If an attacker gains access to one server, they have access to the application, web server, and potentially the local database.
Resource Competition: The database, web server, and application server on the same machine might compete for resources like CPU, memory, and I/O, leading to performance degradation.
Maintenance Overhead: Updates or changes to one component could disrupt other components on the same server.
