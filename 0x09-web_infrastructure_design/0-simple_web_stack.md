Scenario: A user wants to access the website www.foobar.com.

User's Computer:

User enters www.foobar.com in the browser.
The computer doesn't know the IP address associated with this domain, so it needs to resolve the domain name to an IP.
Domain Name System (DNS):

The computer queries a DNS server to resolve the domain name www.foobar.com to an IP.
The DNS server returns the IP 8.8.8.8 (as it's configured with a www record pointing to this IP).
Server (IP: 8.8.8.8):

The user's request reaches the server with IP 8.8.8.8.

Nginx (Web Server): It receives the incoming HTTP request. Its job is to manage and forward this request.

If it's a static file request (e.g., images, CSS, JS), it serves it directly.
If it's a dynamic request, it forwards it to the application server.
Application Server: Processes the dynamic request. It runs your application's code. If data from a database is needed, the app server will make a request to the database.

MySQL (Database): Stores and manages data. It returns data to the application server when queried.

Application Files (Codebase): This is where your website code lives (e.g., PHP, Python, etc.). The application server executes this code.

The result (web page) is sent back via Nginx to the user's computer.

User's Computer:

The browser displays the web page.
Specific Explanations:

Server: A physical or virtual machine that provides data or services to other machines (clients), in this case, web content to browsers.

Domain Name: It's a human-readable address (like www.foobar.com) that points to an IP. It's easier to remember than an IP address.

DNS Record (www): The www in www.foobar.com is a subdomain, represented as a CNAME or A record in the DNS system.

Web Server (Nginx): Manages incoming HTTP requests, serves static files, and routes dynamic requests to the application server.

Application Server: Executes the application code, interacts with the database, and returns dynamic content.

Database (MySQL): A system that manages and stores data in a structured way, allowing efficient retrieval.

Communication: The server and the user's computer communicate using the HTTP/HTTPS protocol over the internet.

Issues with this Infrastructure:

SPOF (Single Point of Failure): Everything is on a single server. If that server goes down, the whole website is offline.

Downtime During Maintenance: Whenever there's a need to deploy new code, or the web server needs to be restarted, the website will be inaccessible.

Scalability Issues: With increasing traffic, this single server setup might struggle to handle the load. There's no way to distribute traffic among multiple servers, nor is there a separate server for the database.
