User's Computer:

User enters www.foobar.com in the browser.
The computer queries a DNS server to resolve the domain name.
DNS:

Returns the IP of the load balancer (HAproxy).
HAproxy (Load Balancer):

Receives the incoming request and decides which server should handle it, based on a distribution algorithm.
For this setup, let's say we use the Round Robin algorithm, which distributes each incoming request to each server in rotation. Itâ€™s simple and effective for distributing load among servers that have similar hardware specifications.
Two Servers:

Both servers have their own instance of Nginx, application server, and application files.

Nginx (Web Server): As before, manages incoming HTTP requests.

Application Server: Processes the dynamic request.

Application Files (Codebase): Each server contains a replica of the website code.

MySQL Database:

Primary (Master) Node: The main database where all writes occur.
Replica (Slave) Node: Replicates data from the primary node in real-time and handles read requests.
User's Computer:

Displays the webpage.
Specifics:

Additional Servers: To handle more traffic and provide redundancy. If one server fails, the other can still serve users.

Load Balancer (HAproxy): Distributes incoming traffic across multiple servers to ensure no single server is overwhelmed. This allows for handling more traffic and provides fault tolerance.

Active-Active vs. Active-Passive: We're using an Active-Active setup. Both servers are active and can handle requests. In Active-Passive, one server is active, and the other is a standby, ready to take over if the active server fails.
MySQL Primary-Replica Cluster:

Primary (Master) Node: Accepts write operations. When data is written to the primary, it's then copied to the replica.
Replica (Slave) Node: Used mainly for read operations, distributing the read load. This can make data retrieval faster as it reduces the load on the primary node.
Issues:

SPOFs (Single Points of Failure):

Load Balancer: If the HAproxy goes down, users can't access either server.
Primary Database Node: If the primary database goes down, data can't be written to the database until it's restored.
Security Issues:

No Firewall: Without a firewall, the servers are exposed to potentially malicious traffic, increasing vulnerability to various attacks.
No HTTPS: Data transferred between the user's computer and the server isn't encrypted, exposing sensitive information.
No Monitoring: Without monitoring, there's no way to be alerted to issues in real-time. This can result in longer downtimes and slower responses to problems.
