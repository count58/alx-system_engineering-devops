0x05-processes_and_signals

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Processes and signals are two fundamental concepts in operating systems. A process is a running program, and a signal is a notification sent to a process by the operating system, another process, or itself. Signals can be used to inform a process of various events, such as user input, termination, suspension, or errors.

The processes_and_signals module in Python provides a high-level interface to processes and signals. It allows you to create, start, and stop processes, send signals to processes, and handle signals in your own code.

The module has a number of features, including:

The ability to create and start processes
The ability to send signals to processes
The ability to handle signals in your own code
A number of built-in signal handlers for common events
The processes_and_signals module is a useful tool for anyone who needs to work with processes and signals in Python. It provides a simple and easy-to-use interface to these powerful concepts.

Here is an example of how to use the processes_and_signals module to create a process and send it a signal:

Python
import processes_and_signals

def signal_handler(signum, frame):
    print("Received signal", signum)

def main():
    process = processes_and_signals.create_process("sleep 5")
    processes_and_signals.signal_handler = signal_handler
    processes_and_signals.send_signal(process, signal.SIGINT)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

This code will create a process that sleeps for 5 seconds. When the process is sleeping, it will receive a SIGINT signal. The signal_handler function will be called to handle the signal. The signal_handler function will simply print a message to the console.

To run this code, you can save it as a file called processes_and_signals.py and then run it from the command line:

python processes_and_signals.py
This will print a message to the console when the process receives the SIGINT signal.
